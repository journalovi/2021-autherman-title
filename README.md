## The JoVI article template

JoVI articles can be written in several different formats. Templates are provided
for each:

- **Quarto**: [index.qmd](index.qmd). The main format used for publication at
JoVI is Quarto, which is a simple markdown-based text format. Writing in this
format will offer the most flexibility and control, but may be a less familiar
writing exprience.

- **Rmarkdown**: [index.Rmd](index.Rmd). You can also write JoVI papers in Rmarkdown.
However, the Quarto format is similar to Rmarkdown and is also supported by the
latest version of RStudio, so if you are already familiar with Rmarkdown you
may wish to try using Quarto instead.

- **Jupyter notebook**: [index.ipynb](index.ipynb). You can write JoBI papers in 
jupyter notebook, which may be desirable if you wish to write JoVI papers using
a collaborative notebook authoring platform such as Juypter Lab or Google Colab.

- **Word**: [index.docx](index.docx). You can write JoVI papers in Word, however
you must be careful to use the built-in styles. During the final paper production
we will assit with converstion from Word to Quarto, but the process will likely
not be as smooth as the other formats.
